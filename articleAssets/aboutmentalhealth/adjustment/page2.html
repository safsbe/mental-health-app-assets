		<p>While it is common for people to have trouble coping with stress and change, an adjustment disorder involves significant distress that continues for several months after a stressful event. This response to stress can disrupt daily activities, such as studying and working, and negatively impact overall enjoyment of life.</p>	

		<p>These reactions can include feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or emotional instability, such as crying more easily. You may also engage in risky or impulsive behaviors. The specific behaviors and emotions experienced can vary from person to person.</p>

		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row;">
			<p>In some cases, a single event can trigger adjustment disorder symptoms, while in other instances, multiple events may build up and push you to a breaking point.</p>
