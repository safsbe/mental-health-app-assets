		<p>Psychotherapy is a treatment that helps individuals with mental health and emotional difficulties. Often combined with medication, it helps people understand themselves better and make positive changes in their lives.</p>

		<p>Psychotherapy can be done individually, with couples, families, or in groups, and is suitable for both children and adults.</p>

		<p>Psychiatric medications can help many individuals with mental illnesses live fulfilling lives. It's important to know what medications you're taking, what symptoms they treat, and any potential side effects. Always follow the prescribed dosages and schedules by your mental health professionals.</p>

		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row;">
			<p>Resolving the stressors can improve symptoms, but psychological interventions are still important for better well-being.</p>
