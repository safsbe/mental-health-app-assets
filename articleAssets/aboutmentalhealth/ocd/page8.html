		<p>OCD symptoms in children are often overlooked, delaying treatment.</p>

		<p>For mild cases, therapy like <b>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</b> alone may be enough. For more severe cases, <b>medication</b>, such as antidepressants, is often prescribed to help reduce anxiety and manage symptoms.</p>

		<p>Medication may be used for severe depression or if therapy alone isn't enough. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is the main psychological treatment, where the person is exposed to their obsessions and prevented from performing the compulsive actions.</p>

		<p><b>Family involvement</b> is also crucial, as they can support the treatment process.</p>

		<p>Over time, this helps reduce anxiety and manage stress. Combining CBT with medication improves results.</p>
