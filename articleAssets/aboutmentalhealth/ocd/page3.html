		<p>
			OCD can be influenced by several factors:
			<br><br>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>Genetics</b>: OCD can sometimes run in families, meaning it can be inherited from a parent.
				</li>
				<br>
				<li>
					<b>Biological factors</b>: Research suggests that OCD may be linked to an imbalance of serotonin, a chemical in the brain.
				</li>
				<br>
				<li>
					<b>Life changes</b>: Major life events, like starting a new job or having a child, can increase stress and responsibilities, which might trigger OCD.
				</li>
				<br>
				<li>
					<b>Behavioral factors</b>: People who are very organized, neat, or like to be in control from a young age may be more likely to develop OCD.
				</li>
				<br>
				<li>
					<b>Personal experiences</b>: Experiencing a traumatic event, like getting a severe rash from touching harmful substances, could lead to compulsions, such as excessive hand washing.
				</li>
			</ul>
