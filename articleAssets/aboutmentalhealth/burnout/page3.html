		<p>
			Burnout is marked by a combination of key symptoms that affect mental, emotional, and physical well-being.
			<br><br>
			<b style="text-decoration: underline;">Exhaustion:</b> At the core of burnout is extreme fatigueâ€”physical, mental, and emotional. It can stem from long hours, overwhelming expectations, and a lack of autonomy or support. Even simple tasks feel draining and causes our focus and motivation to plummet.
			<br><br>
			<b style="text-decoration: underline;">Cynicism (Depersonalization):</b> A sense of detachment from work, colleagues, and responsibilities. People may feel indifferent, negative, or emotionally distant due to conflicts, unfair treatment, or work overload.
			<br><br>
			<b style="text-decoration: underline;">Inefficacy:</b> Burnout can lead to feelings of incompetence, lack of achievement, and reduced productivity. With limited resources, unclear expectations, or insufficient recognition, even seasoned individuals may doubt their skills.
			<br><br>
			Recognizing these signs early is vital for preventing burnout and regaining a healthy balance in work and life.
