			<b style="text-decoration: underline;">Stage 3: Chronic Stress</b>
			<br>
			Stress becomes a daily struggle. Motivation dips, and frustration grows. Symptoms such as irritability, exhaustion, and physical discomfort become more intense and frequent. Some may turn to unhealthy coping mechanisms like smoking, excessive caffeine, or drinking to manage stress.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b style="text-decoration: underline;">Stage 4: Burnout</b>
			<br>
			At this stage, even the simplest tasks feel overwhelming. Training, duties, and social interactions may seem dull and exhausting. You might feel emotionally numb or, conversely, constantly on edge. Dragging yourself through the day feels like an uphill battle.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b style="text-decoration: underline;">Stage 5: Habitual Burnout</b>
			<br>
			If left unaddressed, burnout becomes a way of life. Chronic exhaustion, detachment, and feelings of hopelessness set in. Daily functioning feels like a struggle, and symptoms of depression or apathy may take hold, making it even harder to push through NS.
