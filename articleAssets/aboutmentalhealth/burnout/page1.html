    <p>Burnout is a state of emotional, mental, and physical exhaustion, often leaving individuals feeling empty and drained. It is caused by prolonged exposure to stressful situations. While burnout shares similarities with depression, it is important to distinguish between the two.</p>

    <p>There is still ongoing discussion about how burnout should be defined and diagnosed. However, it is widely recognized that chronic stress and overwork can significantly impact a personâ€™s well-being.</p>
