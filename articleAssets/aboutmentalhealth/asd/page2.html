		<p>Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neuro-developmental condition that typically appears in the early part of your life and lasts through your lifetime. Being a spectrum type of disorder, there is a wide range in the type and severity of symptoms. People with ASD are known to have more challenges with social interactions, and communications and also exhibit restrictive or repetitive behaviours/ interests, which can cause some dysfunction in their school, work, or other aspects of life.</p>
