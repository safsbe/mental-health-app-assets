    <p>Bipolar disorder (formerly called manic-depressive illness or manic depression) can cause unusual swings in a person's mood, energy level, and concentration. Transiting through the various period of high energy (maniac episodes) and low energy (depressive episodes) can be disruptive to their well-being, in turn affect their day-to-day activities as well as their relationship with others. </p>
    
    <p>While there is no direct cure for bipolar, the symptoms can be effectively managed through long term and continuous treatment such as combination of medication and psychotherapy.</p>
