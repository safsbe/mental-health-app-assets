	<h2>WHAT IS IT</h2>

	<p>Bipolar disorder is characterised by extreme mood swings from being very happy and energetic (maniac episode) to very sad and demotivated (depressive episode).</p>

	<p>In 2019, approximately 1 in 150 adults (40 million people, or 0.53% of the global population) were living with bipolar disorder. While the prevalence of bipolar disorder among men and women is approximately equal, available data indicate that women are more often diagnosed.</p>
