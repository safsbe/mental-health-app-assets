		<p>Bipolar disorder is characterised by extreme mood swings from being very happy and energetic (maniac episode) to very sad and demotivated (depressive episode).</p>

		<p>In 2019, approximately 1 in 150 adults (40 million people, or 0.53% of the global population) were living with bipolar disorder. While the prevalence of bipolar disorder among men and women is approximately equal, available data indicate that women are more often diagnosed.</p>

		<p style="flex: 3">The exact cause of bipolar is yet known, but can be triggered by extreme stress, genetic or chemical influence or life-changing events. It can occur to anyone at any point in time.</p>
