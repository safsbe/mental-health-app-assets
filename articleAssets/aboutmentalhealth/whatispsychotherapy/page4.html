			<b>Which type of therapy should it be?</b>
			<br><br>
			This depends on the needs and desired outcome. Far beyond the media portrayal of a person lying on a couch during therapy,  therapy session can be individual, couple, family or even in group settings. There are also many techniques and approaches  a mental health practitioner can utilise.  Each comes with its pros and cons.
			<br><br>
			Studies have found that a person took an average of 2.5 therapists to find a good match. So be patient.
