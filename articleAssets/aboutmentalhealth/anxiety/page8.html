		<p>
			Fortunately, anxiety disorders are treatable. With early diagnosis and proper treatment, the brain can adapt, and many patients recover.
		</p>

		<p>
			Around 60 to 70 percent of people improve and can lead normal lives.
			Treatment aims to reduce and eventually eliminate the symptoms of anxiety disorders while improving quality of life.
		</p>

		<p><b style="text-decoration: underline;">By medications:</b> Antidepressants can help control anxiety with minimal side effects, even with long-term use. Benzodiazepines may be used for short periods.</p>

		<p><b style="text-decoration: underline;">By non-medication treatments:</b> Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is one of the most effective treatments for anxiety. This includes exposure therapy, where people face their fears gradually.</p>

		<p>Other ways to help manage anxiety include learning stress management techniques like relaxation and mindfulness.</p>
