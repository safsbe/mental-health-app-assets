			<tr>
				<td>You attend a party alone and feel awkward at first because you don't know anyone. But you settle in and find a seat, drink or someone to chat with, and your level of alertness reduces.</td>
				<td>You feel very uncomfortable when you set foot at a party. You feel that everyone is scrutinising what you wear and say. You clam up, your heart beats fast and you feel dizzy. The symptoms last even after you leave the premises.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>You get nervous before a job interview and some mild stomach discomfort or a slightly faster than normal heart rate, but the symptoms do not last. Once the interview is over, you feel relieved - or disappointed - but you are no longer nervous.</td>
				<td>Your heart starts to beat very fast, and you feel giddy and short of breath. You are so affected by the symptoms that you decide not to attend the interview.</td>
