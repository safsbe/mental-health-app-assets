    <p>
      Self-care is the practice of taking intentional actions to maintain and can improve your physical, mental, and emotional health, as indicated by studies. By effectively managing everyday stress, self-care promotes greater balance, resilience and a fulfilling life. Itâ€™s about prioritizing your health and happiness to prevent burnout.
    </p>

    <p>
      Neglecting self-care can lead to physical, mental, and emotional exhaustion, resulting in chronic stress, burnout, and a weakened immune system, making us more prone to illness.
