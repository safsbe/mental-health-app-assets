			<b>Circadian Rhythm (“Body Clock”)</b>
			<br>
			Based typically on a 24 hours period, it is key enabler to how we function on a daily basis, including sleep. Light exposure is the known biggest influence on the circadian rhythms, for which we are wakeful in the day but sleepy in the night.
			<br><br>
			The exact amount of necessary sleep can vary across person, depending on your life phase. On average, an adult should get at least 7 hours of sleep each night to avoid incurring sleep debt. As important as sleep quantity is, sleep quality (sleeping without interruptions) is also key to achieving healthy and satisfying sleep!
