  	<p>
			Have you ever wished you had more time to finish your tasks? Or did you feel like there are too many things to juggle, unsure of where to even start? Maybe everything feels chaotic and affects your work/ personal life. If you’ve felt like this, you’re not alone!
		</p>

		<p>
			Prioritisation is an effective method for managing time and resources to complete tasks without feeling overwhelmed. It involves assessing and ranking the list of items based on their importance and urgency. In short, do the first things first.</p>
