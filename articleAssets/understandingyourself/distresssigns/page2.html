			<h2>WHAT IS IT</h2>

			<p>Stress is your body’s natural reaction to any demand that disrupts your usual routine. A little bit of stress <b>(eustress)</b> can be useful, like when it helps you overcome a fear or gives you extra energy to finish a task.</p>
			<p>However, there’s also harmful stress <b>(distress)</b>, which comes from intensive or prolonged worries about things like money, jobs, relationships, or health. Just like a “check engine” light in your car, if you ignore these signals, you might face bigger problems in the future.</p>
