	<p>The presence of adrenaline and cortisol provides us with the sudden burst of energy (fight-or-flight response) which can motivate and help us focus on resolving the problem. As we build skills to control our fight-or-flight tendency, we can turn this energy into something more positive, such as releasing another hormone called oxytocin that will propel us to seek or provide help.</p>

	<p>Finding strategies that promote eustress could bring a bounty of benefits such as making us feel good overall about life, especially when we reached our goals (thatâ€™s a confidence boost)! It builds resilience and develop our coping skills to meet future challenges. It can also strengthen the immune system and support our cardiovascular health! In short,</p>
