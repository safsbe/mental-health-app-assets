  <p>How we experience stress and reap the outcome are largely biased by how we evaluate and respond to the situation. If we think of the stress from unfamiliar/ uncertain situation as opportunities for fun and exploration, we would then see the stress as more welcoming. <b>The fact is whether we are in an actual life-threatening situation or not, our body releases the stress hormone â€“ adrenaline and cortisol!</b></p>
