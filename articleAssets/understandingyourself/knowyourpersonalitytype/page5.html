	<h3>TYPES</h3>

	<p>The Big Five Theory is the most popular approach thus far and suggests that our personality can be described via five broad dimensions O.C.E.A.N â€“ <i>Openness, Conscientiousness, Extroversion, Agreeableness and Neuroticism.</i></p>

	<p>Alongside, there are a plethora of personality tests built on specific personality theories that examine various aspects of your life e.g., your workstyle, your language of love, your socializing preference etc. Most of the online tests are rather informal and meant to entertain or start conversation. Choose a formal and scientifically-backed one if you want a more reliable and valid result.</p>
