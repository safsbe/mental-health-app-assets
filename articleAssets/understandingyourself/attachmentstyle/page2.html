			<h2>WHAT IS IT</h2>

			<p>Attachment theory was first developed by John Bowlby (1907-1990), a British psychoanalyst who wanted to understand the intense distress experienced by infants when separated from their parents.</p>
			<p>Bowlby observed that these infants often engaged in extreme behaviors — such as crying, clinging, or desperately searching — to avoid separation or to regain proximity to a missing parent.</p>
