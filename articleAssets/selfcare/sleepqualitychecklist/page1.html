			Sleep quality is a measure of how well you sleep, i.e., the ability to have uninterrupted sleep. While measuring the number of sleep hours is fairly easy, assessing if you are having quality sleep is less direct. Use this checklist to determine if you are hitting the characteristics of poor sleep quality and bring along the insights for further discussion with your clinicians (e.g., doctor, counsellor, psychologist, therapist) to identify changes that can improve your sleep.
