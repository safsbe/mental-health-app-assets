  <p><b>Circadian Rhythm (“Body Clock”)</b></p>
	<p>Based typically on a 24 hours period, it is key enabler to how we function on a daily basis, including sleep. Light exposure is the known biggest influence on the circadian rhythms, for which we are wakeful in the day but sleepy in the night.</p>
	<p>The exact amount of necessary sleep can vary across person, depending on your life phase. On average, an adult should get at least 7 hours of sleep each night to avoid incurring sleep debt. As important as sleep quantity is, sleep quality (sleeping without interruptions) is also key to achieving healthy and satisfying sleep!</p>
