  <p><b>Find What Works for You:</b> There's no one-size-fits-all approach to what a good break is. Experiment with different techniques of breathing, or combinations of factors to build your optimal pause environment or simply just start observing your surroundings to break your rushing thoughts. You can also explore different activities to find one that interests you. Discover what resonates with you and build your own self-care board, like the one below!</p>  
  <p><b>Embrace Imperfection:</b> Remember, the goal of mindful pauses isn't perfection but presence. It's okay if your mind wanders or if you struggle to fully quiet your thoughts. The act of simply noticing and returning to the present moment is what matters most.</p>
